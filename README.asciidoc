`weercd` is the WeeChat IRC testing server.

It can be used with any IRC client (not only WeeChat).

In the 'flood' mode, various IRC commands are sent in a short time (privmsg,
notice, join/quit, ..) to test client resistance and memory usage (to quickly
detect memory leaks, for example with client scripts).

== Install

This script works with Python 2.x (>= 2.7) and 3.x.

It is *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to connect this server with a client in a test
environment:

* For WeeChat, another home with: `weechat --dir /tmp/weechat`.
* On a test machine, because CPU will be used a lot by client to display
  messages from weercd.
* If possible locally (ie server and client on same machine), to speed up
  data exchange between server and client.

== Run with WeeChat

Open a terminal and run server:

----
python weercd.py
----

Open another terminal and run WeeChat with home in '/tmp/weechat':

----
weechat --dir /tmp/weechat
----

Optional: install script(s) in WeeChat (for example `/script install xxx`).

Add server and connect to it:

----
/server add weercd 127.0.0.1/7777
/connect weercd
----

Wait some months.....

WeeChat still not crashed and does not use 200 TB of RAM ?
Yeah, it's stable!
